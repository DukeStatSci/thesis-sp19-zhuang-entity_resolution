	abstract = {Databases often contain corrupted, degraded, and noisy data with duplicate entries across and within each database. Such problems arise in citations, medical databases, genetics, human rights databases, and a variety of other applied settings. The target of statistical inference can be viewed as an unsupervised problem of determining the edges of a bipartite graph that links the observed records to unobserved latent entities. Bayesian approaches provide attractive benefits, naturally providing uncertainty quantification via posterior probabilities. We propose a novel record linkage approach based on empirical Bayesian principles. Specifically, the empirical Bayesian-type step consists of taking the empirical distribution function of the data as the prior for the latent entities. This approach improves on the earlier HB approach not only by avoiding the prior specification problem but also by allowing both categorical and string-valued variables. Our extension to string-valued variables also involves the proposal of a new probabilistic mechanism by which observed record values for string fields can deviate from the values of their associated latent entities. Categorical fields that deviate from their corresponding true value are simply drawn from the empirical distribution function. We apply our proposed methodology to a simulated data set of German names and an Italian household survey on income and wealth, showing our method performs favorably compared to several standard methods in the literature. We also consider the robustness of our methods to changes in the hyper-parameters.},

	title = {d-blink: Distributed End-to-End Bayesian Entity Resolution},
	abstract = {Entity resolution (ER) (record linkage or de-duplication) is the process of merging
	together noisy databases, often in the absence of a unique identifier. A major
	advancement in ER methodology has been the application of Bayesian generative
	models. Such models provide a natural framework for clustering records to unobserved
	(latent) entities, while providing exact uncertainty quantification and tight performance
	bounds. Despite these advancements, existing models do not scale to realistically-
	sized databases (larger than 1000 records) and they do not incorporate probabilistic
	blocking. In this paper, we propose "distributed blink" or d-blink -- the first scalable
	and distributed end-to-end Bayesian model for ER, which propagates uncertainty in
	blocking, matching and merging. We make several novel contributions, including:
	(i) incorporating probabilistic blocking directly into the model through auxiliary
	partitions; (ii) support for missing values; (iii) a partially-collapsed Gibbs samper;
	and (iv) a novel perturbation sampling algorithm (leveraging the Vose-Alias method)
	that enables fast updates of the entity attributes. Finally, we conduct experiments
	on real and synthetic data which show that d-blink can achieve significant efficiency
	gains in excess of 200x when compared to existing methodology.},

@article{monge_elkan_1997,
	title = {An Efficient Domain-Independent Algorithm for Detecting Approximately Duplicate Datadata Records},
	abstract = {Detecting database records that are approximate duplicates, but not exact duplicates, is an important task. Databases may contain duplicate records concerning the same real-world entity because of data entry errors, because of un-standardized abbreviations, or because of diierences in the detailed schemas of records from multiple databases, among other reasons. In this paper, we present an eecient algorithm for recognizing clusters of approximately duplicate records. Three key ideas distinguish the algorithm presented. First, a version of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for computing minimum edit-distance is used as a domain-independent method to recognize pairs of approximately duplicate records. Second, the union//nd algorithm is used to keep track of clusters of duplicate records incrementally, as pairwise duplicate relationships are discovered. Third, the algorithm uses a priority queue of cluster subsets to respond adaptively to the size and homogeneity of the clusters discovered as the database is scanned. This typically reduces by over 75% the number of times that the expensive pair-wise record matching (Smith-Waterman or other) is applied, without impairing accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic databases and on a real database of bibliographic records connrm the eeectiveness of the new algorithm.},
